# OnlineStorySegmentation
 Code I created to look at the Online Story Segmentation data


Demographic_Summary (complete):
 Takes in data from the demographics questionaire, converts it to a usable format, and prints out the summary of the data

Button Presses_Summary (complete):
 Takes in data from the event segmentation task, converts it to usable format, and sums up the number of presses per participant on each task, then graphs it 

Raster Plot (in progress): 
 Creates a raster plot of button presses, as lines on a graph for each button press, for each participant for each story. Also takes multiple participants and creates a histogram summary for it.
