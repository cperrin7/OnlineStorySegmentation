# OnlineStorySegmentation
 Code I created to look at the Online Story Segmentation data


Demographic_Summary (complete):
 Takes in data from the demographics questionaire, converts it to a usable format, and prints out the summary of the data

Button Presses_Summary (complete):
 Takes in data from the event segmentation task, converts it to usable format, and sums up the number of presses per participant on each task, then graphs it
